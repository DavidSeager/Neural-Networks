In this repository, you’ll find a file containing my attempt to program a neural network from scratch using only NumPy so I could better understand the mathematics and inner workings 
of neural networks. You’ll also find another file where I re-create the same network with PyTorch to learn how to use a modern ML library.

To test both implementations, I train them to behave as AND gates—and, as shown in the Jupyter notebooks included here, they successfully achieve this.
